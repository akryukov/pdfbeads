<h1>pdfbeads v. 1.1 User's Manual</h1>

<p>(c) Alexey Kryukov, 2013</p>

<p>pdfbeads is a small utility intended for creating e-books in PDF format
from specially prepared scanned pages. Unlike other similar utilities,
pdfbeads attempts to implement the approach more commonly used for DjVu files.
Its key feature is separating the scanned page into distinct layers, each
layer having its own compression format and resolution.</p>

<p>Here are some features of pdfbeads:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>JBIG2 and JPEG2000 graphical data compression;</p></li>

<li><p>separating out text and image layers from “mixed” files produced with
<a href="http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/">ScanTailor</a>;</p></li>

<li><p>adding halftone background images to text pages previously
converted to B&amp;W;</p></li>

<li><p>processing indexed images with a limitedо (small) number of colors
so that the colors are preserved and the content is placed into the foreground
layer;</p></li>

<li><p>separating out background and foreground data by masking a source
color image;</p></li>

<li><p>producing PDF files with a table of contents and metadata;</p></li>

<li><p>adding a hidden text layer produced from previously generated hOCR
files or transferring the text data from another PDF file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The program has been called pdfbeads because building an e-book from
separate graphical data seems to me a bit similar to threading beads on a
string. Moreover, this name seems appropriate for a Ruby script, since
it has something to do with jewelry where rubies (like other gems) are
used.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>In order to run the program you’ll need first the Ruby runtime
environment v. 1.8 or above, which is available by default on most Unix-like
systems. A Windows installable package is available at the
<a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a> site. You will
also need RubyGems (the standard Ruby package manager) and some extensions
available (like pdfbeads itself) via the RubyGems framework, namely RMagick,
Nokogiri and PDF::Reader. Note that pdfbeads will may even if the last two
packages are not available. However, without Nokogiri it will not be possible
to read optically recognized text from hOCR files, while PDF::Reader is needed
in order to be able to import the text layer from another PDF file.</p>

<p>If you are interested in creating PDF files using the JBIG2 data compression
format, then your system should have also the jbig2 utility from the
<a href="http://github.com/agl/jbig2enc">jbig2enc</a> package installed.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Downloading and installing the most recent pdfbeads version with the
RubyGems package manager is quite simple. Just type in your command line:</p>

<pre>
gem install pdfbeads
</pre>

<p>Before running the script you should ensure the RMagick extension
is installed and accessible to the Ruby runtime. <strong>Unfortunately,
it is not currently possible to automatically resolve this dependency</strong>,
since in some Linux distributions (Ubuntu in particular) the standard
installation of the RMagick package circumvents the RubyGems engine, so that
the <tt>gem</tt> utility knows nothing about it.</p>

<p>Ubuntu users should also take into account that in this distribution
executable files from gem packages are unpacked into the
<tt>/var/lib/gems/&lt;RUBY_VERSION&gt;/bin</tt> directory, which is not
included into the PATH environment variable by default. So in order to be
able to run pdfbeads without specifying the full path to the executable file
you should either modify the PATH variable as necessary, or move the
<tt>pdfbeads</tt> script into some directory normally used for executables
(<tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> for example).</p>

<h2>Basic principles</h2>

<p>pdfbeads workflow is based upon making a difference between a “main” image
representing a core of the PDF page and various auxiliary files related
with the current page.</p>

<p>Those files which contain scanned text supposed to be placed into the
foreground layer are considered “main”. Images used for this purpose
should normally be previously converted to bitonal. pdfbeads is also
able to process indexed images with a limited number of colors and a white
or transparent background, as well as “mixed” images where bitonal text is
combined with halftone pictures. The latter feature is most useful for
postprocessing files produced with
<a href="http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/">ScanTailor</a>.</p>

<p>A special treatment is applied to files with double extension, where
one of the following suffixes precedes an extension typical for a common
graphical format (TIF(F), PNG, JP(E)G, JP2 or JPX):</p>

<dl>

<dt>bg or sep</dt>
<dd><p>A background image (halftone or indexed);</p></dd>

<dt>fg</dt>
<dd><p>An image supposed to be used to color the foreground layer (like
a FG44 chunk in a DJVU file);</p></dd>

<dt>color</dt>
<dd><p>A color image supposed to be used as a source for producing
images with the <tt>*.bg.*</tt> and <tt>*.fg.*</tt> suffixes;</p></dd>

<dt>An RGB color specification (e.&nbsp;g. <tt>black</tt> or <tt>#ff00ff</tt>)</dt>
<dd><p>A bitonal image supposed to be displayed with the given color in the
target PDF file.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Furthermore, if the current directory contains any hOCR files with
recognized text (their extensions should be either HTM(L) or HOCR),
pdfbeads will attempt to use them for building hidden text layer
in its PDF output.</p>

<p>Some of the auxiliary files which have been mentioned above may be
produced by pdfbeads during an intermediate stage of its work. Since
processing images with the ImageMagick library (which pdfbeads is based on)
can take quite a long time, those files are not removed afterwards from
the hard drive and may be reused on subsequent runs for time saving.
In order to force pdfbeads to recreate those files you may run it with the
<tt>-f</tt> (or <tt>--force-update</tt>) option.</p>

<p>pdfbeads is supposed to be used for building PDF files from previously
processed scanned images, and this is the reason which explains some
of its features and limitations:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>it is not possible to somehow modify scanned images of text pages
(except forcing them to a specific DPI value), for they are supposed to
be created with the settings the user would like to get, so that there is
no need to additionally process them;</p></li>

<li><p>it is not possible as well to convert color or grayscale scanned images
to bitonal. The only exception is those situations (like splitting “mixed”
pages where bitonal text areas are combined with halftone pictures or separating out
background and foreground data from a source color image by applying a mask)
where pdfbeads just finishes the job started by some other applications;</p></li>

<li><p>any background images taken directly from user’s hard drive are
encoded “as is” without any additional processing.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The generic command line syntax is as follows:</p>

<pre>
pdfbeads [options] [files to process] [&gt; output_file.pdf]
</pre>

<p>The list of files to be processed may be either obtained from the
current directory listing or directly specified in the command line.
However in both cases <strong>pdfbeads accepts for processing only those
files whose names match a specific pattern:</strong> the extension should
be either TIF(F) or PNG (the case doesn’t matter) and there should be
no dots inside the base name (i.&nbsp;e. double extensions are not
allowed). The reason for this limitation is that the program, as explained
above, uses dot-separated file name suffixes to denote some types
of auxiliary files, accompanying the scanned text page itself.</p>

<p>Instead of writing the resulting PDF file to the standard output
stream one can use the <tt>-o</tt> (or <tt>--output</tt>) option
followed by the name of the file to be created.</p>

<h2>Processing bitonal images</h2>

<p>The foreground layer of a PDF page, or its “mask”, is created from the
“main” scanned page file passed to pdfbeads. The following rules are applied
here:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>TIFF or PNG images already converted to bitonal are used “as
is”;</p></li>

<li><p>pages with mixed content are cleared from any halftone pictures
(their processing is described in the next section), while the remaining
bitonal image is saved into a file with the same base name and the
<tt>black.tiff</tt> extension. That’s the <tt>black.tiff</tt> image file
which is further used to produce the foreground layer for such a page;</p></li>

<li><p>indexed images with a white or transparent background which contain
a small number of colors (4 by default; this value can be changed via the
<tt>-x</tt> (<tt>--max-colors</tt>) option) are splitted into several
bitonal image files according to the number of colors. Each of those
files is further encoded separately, so that the resulting PDF page
will have several foreground layers, each with its own color. NB: use an
indexed PNG image with a transparent background if you want to produce
a PDF page with a white-colored text.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>It is recommended to encode bitonal text pages as CCITT Group 4 fax
compressed TIFF files, since pdfbeads is usually able to read the image
data from such files without using the ImageMagick library, thus making
the processing speed significantly faster.</p>

<p>By default pdfbeads attempts to apply JBIG2 compression to the foreground
layer, using Adam Langley’s <a href="http://github.com/agl/jbig2enc">jbig2enc</a>
utility. You can run pdfbeads with the <tt>-p</tt> (<tt>--pages-per-dict</tt>)
option in order to directly specify the desired number of PDF document
pages using the common dictionary of shared symbols (15 by default).</p>

<p>If jbig2enc is not accessible to pdfbeads, then the CCITT Group 4 fax
compression method will be used instead. It is also possible to explicitly
request this compression type by specifying the <tt>-m</tt>
(<tt>--mask-compression</tt>) option with the `G4' parameter (or its synonyms:
`Group4', `CCITTFax').</p>

<h2>Processing halftone images</h2>

<p>Halftone images are placed into the background layer of a PDF page.
This layer is normally supposed to have a lower resolution than its mask.
pdfbeads can either take a background image directly from the hard drive
(i.&nbsp;e. from a file with a <strong>bg</strong> or <strong>sep</strong>
extension suffix), or produce it by splitting a mixed image file.</p>

<p>When processing mixed image files pdfbeads first separates pictures
from text areas. This is achieved by filling any black pixels with white.
The resulting image is saved into the hard drive by a such thay, that the
following commkand line options are taken into account:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-b, --bg-compression</dt>
<dd><p>The data compression format. The fololowing values are allowed:
`JPEG2000' (also `JP2' also `JPX'), `JPEG' (or `JPG') and `LOSSLESS'
(synonyms are `DEFLATE' and `PNG'). pdfbeads will attempt to use the JPEG2000
compression by default. However it falls back to JPEG if JPEG2000 format
is not supported by the currently used ImageMagick build (which is often
the case). If the option has been set to LOSSLESS, then pdfbeads will
compress background images with the deflate method. Of course this choice
would normally result into producing a much larger output file than with
JPEG2000 or JPEG.</p></dd>

<dt>-B, --bg-resolution DPI</dt>
<dd><p>The resolution for the background. Reasonable values usually lie
between 150 and 300&nbsp;dpi (300 by default).</p></dd>

<dt>-g, --grayscale</dt>
<dd><p>Forces pdfbeads to convert color images into grayscale. This option
would be useful for processing images which have been produced by scanning
pages with gray pictures in color mode and haven’t been previously converted
to grayscale. Such a situation may often occur, for example, when processing
digital photos with ScanTailor.</p></dd>

<p>When pdfbeads loads previously produced background image from the hard
drive, it doesn’t perform any additional processing. JPEG and JPEG2000
images are inserted into the resulting PDF file “as is”, while images
taken from TIFF and PNG files are compressed with the deflate method.
However if there are several <tt>*.bg.*</tt> or <tt>*.sep.*</tt> files
which have the same base name, but different extensions, then the graphical
format specified with the <tt>--bg-compression</tt> option will take
precedence.</p>

</dl>

<h2>Separating color images using a mask image</h2>

<p>Separating a scanned image into distinct layers is especially difficult
in case the text has been printed above a picture or texture. In order to
effectively package such a page into a pdf file one should prepare two
graphical files:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>a bitonal or indexed image containing just the scanned text or any
other elements supposed to be placed into the foreground layer;</p></li>

<li><p>a color scan of the same page (pdfbeads recognizes such images
by the <tt>*.color.*</tt> filename suffix).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The first file will serve a stencil: basing on its shapes pdfbeads will
attempt to produce from the color scan two new images, so that the first
one (with the <tt>*.bg.*</tt> suffix) will contain just the color
background cleaned up from any text data, while on the second one (with the
<tt>*.fg.*</tt> suffix) just the mask elements with the corresponding
texture will remain. This procedure is very similar to one performed by
the <tt>djvumake</tt> when we run it with the <tt>PPM</tt> option.
In either case the purpose is to produce a 3-layered page where the first
color layer is responsible for the image background while the second one
is used to specify colors and textures for the mask which is placed
above.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the desired result it is necessary that the mask
can be placed above the color images without any shifts or distortions.
On the other hand, it is OK if the two images have different resolutions
(and thus different pixel sizes): in such a case pdfbeads will first resize
the stencil so that it matches the size of the color image. Note that, if
all the text at the page is black (or at least darker than the background),
it would be convenient to use ScanTailor for producing both the source
graphical files. In order to do that one should output the same page first
as “Black and White” and then as “Color/Grayscale”.</p>

<p>Also note that, if the stencil image is represented with an indexed
(but not bitolnal) image with the number of colors equal to or less than
the current value of the <tt>--max-colors</tt> options, then pdfbeads
will not create a <tt>*.fg.*</tt> file: instead it will just place
the stencil with the previously specified colors above the background
layer cleaned up from the text data.</p>

<p>To conclude this section I’d like to mention that the segmentation
algorithm used by pdfbeads has been inspired by
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?p=41498#p41498">a
thread at the ImageMagick forum</a>, where possible methods to remove text
from an image and then fill the resulting “gaps” basing on the values of the
neighboring pixels have been discussed.</p>

<h2>Additional features</h2>

<h3>Adding metadata</h3>

<p>In order to include some information about author, book title etc.
into the PDF file going to be produced by pdfbeads, one should first put
those data into a special ASCII or UTF-8 encoded text file. Each line
of the file should be formatted as follows:</p>

<pre>/&lt;KEYWORD&gt;: "Some text"
</pre>

<p>The following keyword strings are currently recognized by pdfbeads:
<tt>Title</tt>, <tt>Author</tt>, <tt>Subject</tt> and <tt>Keywords</tt>.
Any lines starting with the `#' character are considered comments and
ignored.</p>

<p>A reference to the metadata file  can be passed to pdfbeads via the
<tt>-M</tt> (or <tt>--meta</tt>) option.</p>

<h3>Page labels</h3>

<p>pdfbeads allows to generate page labels which may be then displayed by
a PDF viewer instead of physical page numbers. Thus it is possible
to bring page numbering of the electronic document into accordance with
the pagination of the paper book. Page labels may be specified with the
<tt>-L</tt> (or <tt>--labels</tt>) command line key. This option takes
an argument which should be enclosed into quotation marks and may contain
one or more numbering range specifications, separated with semicolons.</p>

<p>A numbering range is constructed from the following components (each of
them being optional):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The physical number of the first page of the given range in the
PDF document, separated with a colon from the rest of the specification.
Note that pages in PDF documents are numbered starting from zero, so for
the first range this value should always be zero.</p></li>

<li><p>An arbitrary numbering prefix (any characters, except a double
quotation mark, a colon, a semicolon, and a percent sign are allowed
here).</p></li>

<li><p>A numbering format description, which starts from a percent sign
followed by a single Latin letter corresponding to a particular numbering
style:</p></li>

<dl>

<dt>D</dt>
<dd><p>arabic digits;</p></dd>

<dt>R</dt>
<dd><p>uppercase Roman numerals;</p></dd>

<dt>r</dt>
<dd><p>lowercase Roman numerals;</p></dd>

<dt>A</dt>
<dd><p>uppercase Latin letters;</p></dd>

<dt>a</dt>
<dd><p>lowercase Latin letters.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Between the percent sign and the numbering format identifier it is
possible to put an arbitrary number, thus setting the number to be
displayed for the first page of the given range (1 by default).</p>

</ul>

<p>Suppose for example that a book starts from two unnumbered title pages
followed by 32 pages numbered with roman digits. Then goes an arabic
pagination, which, however, starts straight from 33. So the following argument
for the <tt>--labels</tt> option would be appropriate:</p>

<pre>
"0:Title %D;2:%R;34:%33D"
</pre>

<h3>Building table of contents</h3>

<p>pdfbeads allows to add table of contents (PDF bookmarks) to the PDF file
to be generated. This is done with the <tt>-C</tt> (or <tt>--toc</tt>) option,
which accepts as an argument a path to a text file.</p>

<p>The TOC file should be UTF-8 encoded and consist of lines formatted
as follows (lines beginning from the `#' character are considered comments
and ignored):</p>

<pre>
&lt;indent&gt;"Heading" "Page number" [0|-|1|+]
</pre>

<p>The heading level is determined by its indent (which may be formed either
from spaces or from tabs, but mixing both styles inside the same file is not
allowed). The indent is followed by the fields of heading and page number,
which are separated with any number of space characters and may be enclosed
into double quotation marks if mecessary. The last optional parameter
specifies, if this TOC entry should be displayed unfolded by default (the
characters `+' and `1' mean “yes”).</p>

<p>It is a good idea to use the <tt>--toc</tt> option together with
<tt>--labels</tt>. Thus it is possible to use in the TOC file the same
page numbers as in the paper book without taking care about any shifts
of the numbering.</p>

<h3>Adding text layer</h3>

<p>It is possible with pdfbeads to create PDF files with a hidden text
layer. The text for a hidden layer may be either obtained from
<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dfxcv4vc_67g844kf">hOCR</a>
files (hOCR is a HTML language extension, allowing to store information
about exact positioning of characters and markup elements on the page) or
imported from another PDF file.</p>

<p>In order to create hOCR files one should use an OCR application which
supports this output format, such as
<a href="https://launchpad.net/cuneiform-linux/">Cuneiform</a> or
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract</a>.
The recognized text should be placed into the same directory as other project
files by a such way that each hOCR file should have the same base name as its
source image, while the extension should be either HTM(L) or HOCR. hOCR files
are automatically processed by pdfbeads if only the Nokogiri extension is
installed and accessible to the Ruby engine.</p>

<p>Another possible solution is to import an OCR layer from another PDF file
(naturally the later should be produced by recognizing the same set
of images which is supposed to be processed with pdfbeads). The path to the
file can be passed to pdfbeads via the <tt>-T</tt> (or <tt>-text-pdf</tt>)
option. This feature is especially important in those cases where one has
to use a commercial OCR application (such as
<a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/finereader/">ABBYY Finereader</a>), which
doesn't support the hOCR format. <strong>Warning:</strong> you may
need to experiment with your OCR application options related with PDF output
to get the best correspondance between the layout of the recognized
text and the source image.</p>

<h3>Processing files with the right-to-left text direction</h3>

<p>The <tt>-R</tt> (or <tt>--right-to-left</tt> option allows to mark the
PDF file produced by pdfbeads with a special flag indicating that the main
text direction for the given document is right-to-left. This flag will allow
Adobe Reader&trade; to correctly order pages when displaying them in the
side-by-side mode.</p>
